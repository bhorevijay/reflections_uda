When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i would be done with a working feature and i would want it be accessible to others (developers, public),
i would user a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Possibly because the Git automatic sync with remote repository might cause incomplete code state in local.
Manually, i would surely know that changes are complete on the remote and my local repository is ready for updating.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks exist on Github whereas clones and branches exist on local machines.
I would use:
 1. Fork: when i want to use already existing code to add some feature and at the same time give credit to user who added it.
 2. Clone: when i want to get a copy of github repository into local machine for fixing bugs in it, adding features into it.
 3. Branches: Keeping track of commits.
