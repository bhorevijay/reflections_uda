What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i initialize a repository, a hidden file .git is added to the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate state between working directory and repository. We can selectively add files to the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can run git add for only those files that i want to be part of one commit. 
Since all the files in staging area are committed together to repository, we have one commit for logic change.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

cons: not sure
