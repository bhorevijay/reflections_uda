What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i initialize a repository, a hidden file .git is added to the folder.
The current folder is setup as a master branch. And there is an initial commit. 
Since there is no current commit, git log throws error.
The contents of the directory (files in it) are added as untracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate state between working directory and repository. We can selectively add files to the staging area.
More than one file in the staging area can be pushed into repository as a logical unit.
I think, the staging area lets user decide the files to be included in one commit as opposed to committing all files together.
